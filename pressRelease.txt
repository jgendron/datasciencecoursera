Jay's ideas:

What: explain the capstone course . also what it took to get to that point and how many were involved

So what: explain why the capston is important (challenge, credibility of program, realworld experience). provide quote

now what: highlight the results. provide some anecdotal quote from participant

Closure: Note the first official capstone began october 27. We would like to thank our dry run participants for their dedication to a good cause..blah blah blah
